# Number Classification API

The **Number Classification API** is a simple and interactive API that takes a number as input and provides its mathematical properties, such as whether it is prime, perfect, or Armstrong. It also calculates the digit sum and fetches a fun fact about the number from the [Numbers API](http://numbersapi.com/).
